## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added

#### Onboarding
- Real onboarding form (`app/(onboarding)/onboarding/page.tsx`) collecting name + lab/team name
- `POST /api/onboarding` creates the `User`, `Team`, and `TeamMember` records (idempotent); seeds the team at `literature_review` phase
- Dashboard layout now redirects users without a team to `/onboarding`

#### Literature Review — Quiz
- Structured **graded comprehension quiz**: free-response (not MCQ), AI-generated questions grounded in the paper's full text, each with a server-only grading key
- Pedagogy/grading rules externalized to `lib/literature/quiz-rubric.md` (tunable, loaded into both generation and grading prompts); knobs `QUIZ_QUESTION_COUNT` (5) and `QUIZ_PASS_THRESHOLD` (70) in `lib/literature/quiz.ts`
- `POST /api/papers/[id]/quiz` generates a quiz; `POST …/quiz/grade` grades all answers in one call (aggregate score, pass/fail); `GET …/quiz` returns the last graded session
- Persistence: `PaperQuizSession` + `PaperQuizAttempt`; proficiency persisted on `papers.proficiency_demonstrated`
- Past results (answers + Nova's feedback) reload on reopen; header tabs switch between **Quiz results** and **Discuss with Nova** (active tab gold); pass → green "Proficiency demonstrated" banner (mirrored on the source slot)

#### Literature Review — Viewer, Chat, Delete
- **In-panel PDF viewer**: PDF bytes stored in `papers.pdf_data`, streamed inline (auth'd) via `GET /api/papers/[id]/file`
- **Chat persistence**: `PaperChatMessage` model; `GET/POST /api/papers/[id]/chat` save and reload the per-user conversation
- Nova replies rendered as **Markdown** (`react-markdown` + `remark-gfm`, styled via `.chat-md`)
- **Delete source** button (`DELETE /api/papers/[id]`, cascades quiz/chat/notes)

#### Discovery — Persistence, Topic, Restyle
- Discovery tree persisted to the DB (`discovery_nodes`, team-scoped) via `GET/POST/DELETE /api/discovery/tree` and `PATCH/DELETE …/tree/[id]`; store hydrates from DB instead of `localStorage`
- **Final research topic** stored on `Team.topic` (`GET/POST /api/discovery/topic`); shown on the Discovery home, settable from the explorer bar or any starred item
- Full **pixel-art restyle** of Discovery (home, search, Wikipedia reader, tree, branch panel) to match the game aesthetic; smooth-animated FAQ accordion; "← Back" button

#### Discovery — YouTube deep dives
- Paste-only YouTube exploration (no API key, no quota): `POST /api/discovery/youtube/resolve` resolves a URL → `{ videoId, title }` via public oEmbed
- Embedded IFrame player; **⌘V/Ctrl+V auto-capture**; `addYouTubeVideo` branches off the current node
- Unified source-tagged forest tree (`DiscoverySource += youtube`, `youtubeVideoId`/`youtubeTitle` columns); ▶ markers on video nodes; cross-source bridging (a video can branch off a Wikipedia node)
- New "What about YouTube deep dives?" FAQ on the Discovery home

### Changed
- **PDF parsing switched from `pdf-parse` to `unpdf`** — in-process, ~250 ms, serverless-ready; extracted text now stored in `papers.full_text` (was temporarily in `content_hash`)
- Paper metadata extraction + Q&A use **prompt caching** on the paper text (follow-up turns ~10% cost)
- Q&A chat reframed as post-quiz discussion (proficiency is now owned exclusively by the quiz, not the chat)
- Clerk redirect env vars migrated to `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` / `SIGN_UP_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL` (deprecation)

### Fixed
- Q&A split view: the PDF pane no longer overflows and hides the quiz/chat panel (`min-w-0` flexbox fix)
- Filled literature slots no longer collapse to a thin line (`shrink-0`)
- Quiz/chat/onboarding/topic inputs given dark backgrounds so typed text is visible
- Chat 500s eliminated: persistence is best-effort (reply never lost) and the conversation is sanitized to start at the first user turn

### Removed
- **Citation graph** feature: `/api/citation-graph`, the graph page, `PaperCitation`, `CitationEdge`, `PaperCluster`
- **Embeddings + clustering**: `embedding` column, `pgvector` extension, `PaperSummary`, and the `voyageai` / `hdbscan` / `langchain-text-splitters` deps (Python service); `embeddings.py` + `citation_extractor.py` deleted
- `pdf-parse` and `@types/pdf-parse` (replaced by `unpdf`)

### Dependencies
- Added: `unpdf`, `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`
- Removed: `pdf-parse`, `@types/pdf-parse` (web); `voyageai`, `hdbscan`, `langchain-text-splitters` (ai-service)

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added

#### Environment & Tooling
- Installed `@anthropic-ai/sdk` and `pdf-parse` npm packages in the web app
- Added `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to `.env.local` (and `.env.example` template)
- Configured `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds` to permit native addon compilation for `@clerk/shared`, `@prisma/client`, `@prisma/engines`, `prisma`, `sharp`, `msgpackr-extract`, `unrs-resolver`
- Added `font-pixel` (`Press_Start_2P`) as a Tailwind CSS utility in `tailwind.config.ts`

#### Landing Page (`apps/web/app/page.tsx`)
- Replaced the old multi-section marketing homepage (hero, feature grid, footer) with a minimal pixel-art landing screen
- Dark navy background (`#0d1b2e`), pixel font throughout, yellow accent (`#F5C518`)
- SVG recreation of the NOVA Lab mascot (figure hunched over a table) rendered inline alongside the "NOVA / Lab" heading
- Single CTA button "↑ ENTER YOUR LAB" links to `/sign-in`
- Logged-in users are still immediately redirected to `/lab`

#### Lab Scene — All Buildings Visible (`apps/web/components/lab/LabScene.tsx`)
- Phase gating temporarily removed from building visibility: all 7 gateway buildings now render regardless of `teams.phase`
- Lock gating also bypassed: all buildings are clickable regardless of phase
- Both bypasses are marked with `// TODO: restore` comments for re-enabling once progression integration begins

#### Literature Review Feature (`apps/web/components/literature/LiteratureFeature.tsx`)
- New component replacing the prior `StubFeature` placeholder, registered in `featureRegistry.tsx`
- **25-slot list view**: displays all 25 required source slots; filled slots show paper metadata, empty slots show as dashed-border rectangles
- **Upload**: first empty slot renders a centered "Upload source" button with drag-and-drop support; clicking opens a native file picker (PDF only)
- **Optimistic UI**: uploaded paper appears immediately as a placeholder with status `uploading` → `processing` → `ready` via 3-second polling
- **Proficiency banner**: every paper without demonstrated proficiency shows an orange "Proficiency not demonstrated" badge above its row
- **Action buttons** per ready paper: "PDF" (opens file in new tab) and "Q&A" (opens split review view)
- **Progress bar + counter**: yellow progress bar and `N / 25` readout in the panel header
- **Q&A split view**: clicking Q&A replaces the panel body with a two-column layout — PDF iframe on the left, chat interface on the right (mirrors Discovery's Wikipedia reader + tree layout)
- Chat is pre-seeded with Nova's opening message; user messages sent via `POST /api/papers/[id]/chat`; Enter key submits
- `PROFICIENCY_DEMONSTRATED` hidden signal stripped from display; triggers removal of the orange banner for that paper

#### API Routes
- `POST /api/papers` — accepts `multipart/form-data` PDF upload; parses text with `pdf-parse`; creates `papers` row with `status = processing`; stores extracted text in `contentHash` field; fires async Claude call (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) to extract title, authors, and abstract; marks paper `ready` on completion
- `GET /api/papers` — returns all papers for the authenticated user's team
- `GET /api/papers/[id]` — returns single paper by ID (used for status polling)
- `POST /api/papers/[id]/chat` — runs a tutoring conversation against the paper's extracted text using `claude-sonnet-4-6`; enforces team ownership; returns `{ reply }` JSON

#### Claude System Prompts
- **Extraction prompt** (in `POST /api/papers`): instructs Claude to return a JSON object `{ title, authors, abstract }` from raw PDF text; used server-side only
- **Q&A tutor prompt** (in `POST /api/papers/[id]/chat`): Nova persona; assesses comprehension across four criteria (hypothesis, methodology, findings, relevance); emits `PROFICIENCY_DEMONSTRATED` signal on a new line when all four are met; encourages genuine understanding over surface recitation

### Changed

- `apps/web/lib/featureRegistry.tsx`: `literature_review` entry changed from `StubFeature` to dynamically imported `LiteratureFeature`
- `apps/web/app/api/papers/route.ts`: replaced the prior stub implementation (which returned `501 Not Implemented`) with full upload + async processing logic

### Removed

- Old multi-section landing page content (nav bar, hero section with gradient heading, feature grid with emoji cards, footer)
- Citation Graph tab from literature review (removed per product decision; will be revisited in a later milestone)
- Upload / Library tab split (merged into single unified 25-slot view per product decision)
