## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added

#### Environment & Tooling
- Installed `@anthropic-ai/sdk` and `pdf-parse` npm packages in the web app
- Added `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to `.env.local` (and `.env.example` template)
- Configured `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds` to permit native addon compilation for `@clerk/shared`, `@prisma/client`, `@prisma/engines`, `prisma`, `sharp`, `msgpackr-extract`, `unrs-resolver`
- Added `font-pixel` (`Press_Start_2P`) as a Tailwind CSS utility in `tailwind.config.ts`

#### Landing Page (`apps/web/app/page.tsx`)
- Replaced the old multi-section marketing homepage (hero, feature grid, footer) with a minimal pixel-art landing screen
- Dark navy background (`#0d1b2e`), pixel font throughout, yellow accent (`#F5C518`)
- SVG recreation of the NOVA Lab mascot (figure hunched over a table) rendered inline alongside the "NOVA / Lab" heading
- Single CTA button "↑ ENTER YOUR LAB" links to `/sign-in`
- Logged-in users are still immediately redirected to `/lab`

#### Lab Scene — All Buildings Visible (`apps/web/components/lab/LabScene.tsx`)
- Phase gating temporarily removed from building visibility: all 7 gateway buildings now render regardless of `teams.phase`
- Lock gating also bypassed: all buildings are clickable regardless of phase
- Both bypasses are marked with `// TODO: restore` comments for re-enabling once progression integration begins

#### Literature Review Feature (`apps/web/components/literature/LiteratureFeature.tsx`)
- New component replacing the prior `StubFeature` placeholder, registered in `featureRegistry.tsx`
- **25-slot list view**: displays all 25 required source slots; filled slots show paper metadata, empty slots show as dashed-border rectangles
- **Upload**: first empty slot renders a centered "Upload source" button with drag-and-drop support; clicking opens a native file picker (PDF only)
- **Optimistic UI**: uploaded paper appears immediately as a placeholder with status `uploading` → `processing` → `ready` via 3-second polling
- **Proficiency banner**: every paper without demonstrated proficiency shows an orange "Proficiency not demonstrated" badge above its row
- **Action buttons** per ready paper: "PDF" (opens file in new tab) and "Q&A" (opens split review view)
- **Progress bar + counter**: yellow progress bar and `N / 25` readout in the panel header
- **Q&A split view**: clicking Q&A replaces the panel body with a two-column layout — PDF iframe on the left, chat interface on the right (mirrors Discovery's Wikipedia reader + tree layout)
- Chat is pre-seeded with Nova's opening message; user messages sent via `POST /api/papers/[id]/chat`; Enter key submits
- `PROFICIENCY_DEMONSTRATED` hidden signal stripped from display; triggers removal of the orange banner for that paper

#### API Routes
- `POST /api/papers` — accepts `multipart/form-data` PDF upload; parses text with `pdf-parse`; creates `papers` row with `status = processing`; stores extracted text in `contentHash` field; fires async Claude call (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) to extract title, authors, and abstract; marks paper `ready` on completion
- `GET /api/papers` — returns all papers for the authenticated user's team
- `GET /api/papers/[id]` — returns single paper by ID (used for status polling)
- `POST /api/papers/[id]/chat` — runs a tutoring conversation against the paper's extracted text using `claude-sonnet-4-6`; enforces team ownership; returns `{ reply }` JSON

#### Claude System Prompts
- **Extraction prompt** (in `POST /api/papers`): instructs Claude to return a JSON object `{ title, authors, abstract }` from raw PDF text; used server-side only
- **Q&A tutor prompt** (in `POST /api/papers/[id]/chat`): Nova persona; assesses comprehension across four criteria (hypothesis, methodology, findings, relevance); emits `PROFICIENCY_DEMONSTRATED` signal on a new line when all four are met; encourages genuine understanding over surface recitation

### Changed

- `apps/web/lib/featureRegistry.tsx`: `literature_review` entry changed from `StubFeature` to dynamically imported `LiteratureFeature`
- `apps/web/app/api/papers/route.ts`: replaced the prior stub implementation (which returned `501 Not Implemented`) with full upload + async processing logic

### Removed

- Old multi-section landing page content (nav bar, hero section with gradient heading, feature grid with emoji cards, footer)
- Citation Graph tab from literature review (removed per product decision; will be revisited in a later milestone)
- Upload / Library tab split (merged into single unified 25-slot view per product decision)
